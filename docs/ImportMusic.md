## Types of Audio Files

Rhythmiga 2 supports MP3 (.mp3), OGG Vorbis (.ogg), and WAV (.wav) files.

## Add Offset to Audio File

The audio file needs to have a few moments of silence at the start of the file, this gives the game time to create the notes. If you are working with the audio file in a DAW (Digital Audio Workstation) such as FL Studio, then move the audio file back one measure in the playlist before exporting it. Otherwise, Audacity is a good alternative and adding the offset is the same as in a DAW. Make sure to first set the tempo to the same tempo as the song.

## Import Music to Rhythmiga 2

Once you have prepared the audio file it is time to import the file to Rhythmiga 2. Open Rhythmiga 2 and head to the Import Music & Beatmap tool. Here, press the Import Music button,navigate to where you placed the audio file, and select it. Once imported, you can listen to file to ensure it is the correct file. Re-importing the file will override the previous file as well as the beatmaps associated with it. The audio file must be imported before any beatmaps.
